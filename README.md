# Get data from MySql

You can use this simple code in order to retrieve certain entries from the file maindb.sql. Additionally, there is the possibility to get more or fewer rows from an existing database with a dropdown choice.

As local server I am using XAMPP, the file maindb.sql is populated with fake data ([thank you Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)) for testing out the code.
